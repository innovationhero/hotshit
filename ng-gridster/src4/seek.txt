Git feature request: make sourcecode.file and questions-answers.file where QA.file basically is binded to the sourcecode.file line number explaining what each line of code do... and if the sourcecode.file line numbers change the answers is adjusted accordingly 

example:

line 3 in the sourcecode file have the corssponding line 3 explainination in the questions-answers.file, if someone adds a new line of code above line 3 in the sourcecode file then line 3 will become line 4, so the QA.file adjusts its answers that used to be for line 3 to be these are the QAs for line 4
