jsCats
======

Javascript experiments and learning projects utilizing the Petfinder API.

Each sub-folder is a slightly different version of the same project - a browsing widget for cats available at the House of Mews in Memphis, TN.
The plan is to eventually have different version demonstrating features and code from
* AngularJS
* Backbone.js
* Sencha Touch

So far it's just AngularJS. 

## ngCatsHOM
This iteration of jsCats closely reproduces the Flex based widget on www.houseofmews.com
It is written using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and features a service module and two controllers.
An example is viewable at http://ericterpstra.com/apps/jsCats/jsCatsHOM/

## ngCats
A much improved version of the cats project.  It no longer looks like the original, but a lot of bad practices were fixed 
and a couple new features were added.  Take a look at http://ericterpstra.com/apps/jsCats/jsCats/

That's it for now...
