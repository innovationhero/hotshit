Well, even though many of my House of Mews roommates go along with that theory, I am my own cat and will do what I please, thank you very much. I am curious and inquisitive (can&#39;t you tell from my expression?) but will keep my distance. However, in a quiet moment when I am in a basket, I will allow myself to be petted and I must admit it feels pretty good. I came to the House of Mews, fearful, with my 4 brothers and sisters (Adrian, Trini, Trudy and Toni) and just haven&#39;t figured out those silly humans yet. My brothers and sisters have decided they like humans for the most part, and they keep bugging me about it.....siblings! However, some people say that with a loving home, with a special loving and patient person, who is interested in working with fearful kitties, I might learn to open up some and become a bit more affectionate.
