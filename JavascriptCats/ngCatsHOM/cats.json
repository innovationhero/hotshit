Wait a minute, that sounded like a 12-step program meeting, lets start over. I am a handsome, very large black male cat. I mean, I might be the biggest cat here at the House of Mews! I also have huge yellow eyes that can turn from almond-shape to huge round circles in seconds! I am very curious and inquisitive (why do you think I get those big eyes?). Anyway, I was abandoned (along with my siblings Bach and Aurora) and I guess I was never really socialized around people the way I should have been, and now I am somewhat fearful of people (and loud noises, like vacuums). If you want to pet me you just need to take it slow. Just choose a quiet moment, come on over, and slowly hold your hand out for me to sniff first. Depending on my mood, I sometimes like to be petted on my head and chin, and I even have been brushed a few times. Dont freak out if I hiss at you, its just my way of telling you I am a little scared at first. Would you want someone 10 times your size reaching out for you? Oh, and if you have TREATS, Ill almost always let you pet me...well maybe just a little.
